# Telegram Task Scheduler Bot - Technical Specification

## 1. System Overview

A stateless Telegram bot that processes natural language task batches, auto-classifies them as [work] or [personal], and returns the next 3 occurrence dates/times for each task.

## 2. Core Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Input Processing
- **Input Format**: Single Telegram message containing one or more natural language tasks
- **Task Separation**: Natural language separation (no explicit delimiters required)
- **Batch Limitation**: Maximum tasks per batch limited by Telegram's 4096 UTF-8 character message limit
- **Task Types**: Support both one-time and recurring tasks
- **Single Message Constraint**: Only process complete batches within single messages

### 2.2 Task Classification
- **Auto-Classification**: Use GPT-5 to classify each task as [work] or [personal]
- **Classification Logic**: Common sense classification based on task content
- **No Confidence Threshold**: LLM decides autonomously whether clarification is needed
- **Output Format**: Display classification as tags (e.g., "[work]", "[personal]")

### 2.3 Date/Time Processing
- **Timezone**: Fixed GMT+0 (non-configurable)
- **Date Formats**: Support both relative ("next Monday") and absolute ("January 15th") dates
- **Occurrence Limit**: Return maximum 3 next occurrences per task
- **Recurring Patterns**: Support patterns like "every weekday", "monthly", "every 2 weeks", etc.
- **Date Range**: No maximum future date limit

### 2.4 Clarification System
- **Trigger Conditions**: Request clarifications when:
  - No time specified in task
  - Ambiguous dates
  - Multiple potential tasks in single sentence
  - Task classification uncertainty
- **Clarification Preference**: LLM should prefer immediate decision over clarification requests
- **Context Retention**: Maintain conversation context during clarification phase
- **User Response**: User must respond to clarifications before proceeding

## 3. Workflow Specification

### 3.1 Main Workflow
```
User Input ‚Üí Task Parsing ‚Üí Clarifications (if needed) ‚Üí Parsed Task Display ‚Üí 
User Approval ‚Üí Final Output ‚Üí Context Flush ‚Üí End
```

### 3.2 Detailed State Flow

#### State 1: Awaiting User Input
- Bot waits for user message
- Accept any Telegram user (no authentication required)
- Only process complete task batches

#### State 2: Task Processing
- Parse tasks using GPT-5
- Classify each task as [work] or [personal]
- Identify missing information requiring clarification

#### State 3: Clarification (Optional)
- Send clarification questions if needed
- User must respond to clarifications
- User CANNOT send new tasks during this phase
- Use /clear command to abandon current context

#### State 4: Parsed Task Display
- Show structured natural language summary of parsed tasks
- Include classification tags for each task
- Display inline buttons: Approve ‚úÖ / Reject ‚ùå
- Button constraints: callback_data limited to 64 bytes

#### State 5: User Decision
- **Approve**: Proceed to final output
- **Reject**: Flush context and return to State 1

#### State 6: Final Output
- Display 3 next occurrences for each task
- Format: "Next: Jan 15, 2025 at 14:00 GMT" for each occurrence
- Context automatically flushed
- Conversation ends

## 4. Error Handling Requirements

### 4.1 Input Validation
- **Invalid Dates**: Reject impossible dates (e.g., "February 30th") with error message
- **Invalid Times**: Reject invalid times (e.g., "25:00") with error message
- **Unrelated Input**: Return error for non-task-related messages (e.g., "hello", random text)
- **Graceful Errors**: All errors must return user-friendly messages and log internally

### 4.2 System Constraints
- **Message Length**: Handle Telegram's 4096 character limit gracefully
- **Button Data**: Ensure callback_data stays within 64-byte limit
- **Rate Limiting**: Comply with Telegram Bot API rate limits

## 5. State Management

### 5.1 Context Rules
- **Stateless Between Conversations**: No memory across separate conversations
- **Context During Processing**: Maintain context only during active task processing
- **Context Flush Triggers**:
  - User approves final output
  - User rejects parsed tasks
  - Manual /clear command
  - System error

### 5.2 Context Constraints
- User cannot send new tasks during clarification phase
- Context contains only current task batch (no historical data)
- No cross-user data retention

## 6. Technical Constraints

### 6.1 Telegram API Limits
- **Message Length**: 4096 UTF-8 characters maximum
- **Inline Button Data**: 1-64 bytes per callback_data
- **Button Layout**: Maximum 8 buttons per row
- **API Rate Limits**: Standard Telegram Bot API limits apply

### 6.2 LLM Integration
- **Model**: GPT-5
- **Processing**: Handle both classification and parsing
- **No Confidence Scores**: Internal processing only, not exposed to users

## 7. Output Specifications

### 7.1 Parsed Task Display Format
```
üìã Parsed Tasks:

1. [work] Team meeting every Monday
   - Time: 14:00 GMT
   - Recurrence: Weekly
